# Pull Name from Hat
This simple application will allow you to add names to a "Name(s) in the Hat" list one at a time by entering a name in the text box and clicking the 'Add' button.  If you click the 'Add' button without any input, you will be prompted with an alert message.  Also, leading and trailing white space(s) are removed automatically.  Once a name is added, the text box is automatically cleared for the next entry.  

When you click the 'Pull' button, it will remove a random name from the "Name(s) in the Hat" list and place it in the "Pulled Name(s)" list.  There must be a minimum of 2 names in the "Name(s) in the Hat" list.

The 'Clear' button will remove all of the names in the "Pulled Name(s)" list and place them back in the "Name(s) in the Hat" list.  It will also clear the text box, if populated.

The 'Reset' button will clear both list and the text box.
